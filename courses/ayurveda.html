            **AYUSH** is an acronym for the traditional and non-conventional systems of medicine in India: Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy. These systems of medicine are gaining popularity for their holistic and natural approach to health.

            Think of it as a career in natural healing. If your child is interested in a holistic approach to medicine, is curious about traditional remedies, and wants to help people live a healthier, more balanced life, an AYUSH degree is a great fit. It is the **foundation** for a career in alternative medicine.
