            A **Creative Diploma** is a short-term course that students can take after Class 10 to pursue a passion in a creative field. These programs are designed for students who are artistically inclined and want to turn their hobbies into a professional career.

            Think of it as a way to specialize in a creative skill early on. If your child is good at drawing, designing, or has a passion for a particular art form, this is a great way to get professional training and enter a fast-growing industry. It's the **foundation** for careers in fields like design, animation, and fashion.
