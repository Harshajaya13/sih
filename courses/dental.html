            **Dentistry** is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the oral cavity. The undergraduate degree for this is a **BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery)**. It is a five-year course that prepares students to become dental professionals.

        <p>
            Think of it as a career that is part-doctor, part-artist. If your child is interested in health, has good manual dexterity (good with their hands), and is detail-oriented, a career in dentistry could be a great fit. It is the **foundation** for a career in oral health and surgery.
