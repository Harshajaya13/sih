            Engineering is one of the most popular career paths for students who complete the MPC (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry) stream. An engineering degree, typically a **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)** or **Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)**, is a four-year course that trains students to become problem-solvers who design, build, and innovate.

            Think of it as a career that builds the future. If your child is fascinated by technology, enjoys solving complex problems, and wants to create new products or systems, engineering is a perfect fit. It is the **backbone** of modern society, driving progress in everything from smartphones to skyscrapers.
