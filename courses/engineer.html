            Engineering is one of the most popular career paths for students who complete the MPC (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry) stream. An engineering degree, typically a **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)** or **Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)**, is a four-year course that trains students to become problem-solvers who design, build, and innovate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it as a career that builds the future. If your child is fascinated by technology, enjoys solving complex problems, and wants to create new products or systems, engineering is a perfect fit. It is the **backbone** of modern society, driving progress in everything from smartphones to skyscrapers.

            Key Engineering Fields üöÄ
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different branches of engineering. Some of the most common ones are:
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer Science Engineering (CSE): Designing software, apps, and computer systems. This field is booming right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mechanical Engineering: Focusing on machines and mechanical systems. Think of car engines, robots, and manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil Engineering: Designing and building structures like bridges, buildings, and roads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE): Working with electricity, circuits, and power systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chemical Engineering: Applying chemistry and physics to design processes for producing useful chemicals and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students get a deep understanding of their chosen field and learn how to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems.
