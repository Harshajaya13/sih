            An **ITI (Industrial Training Institute)** course is a vocational training program for students who have completed Class 10. These courses are short-term and highly specialized, designed to give students specific job-oriented skills in a particular trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it as learning a specific skill, like a craftsman's apprenticeship. If your child wants to get a job in a specific trade quickly, like a mechanic, electrician, or welder, an ITI course is the fastest way to get there. It's a direct path to a skilled labor job and a stable income.
