            After completing Class 10, students in India often choose a "stream" of subjects to focus on for their next two years (Class 11 and 12). The MPC stream is one of the most popular choices. MPC stands for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. It's the perfect choice for a child who enjoys problem-solving, is good with numbers, and is curious about how things work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it like this: if your child wants to build a house, they need to learn about different types of bricks, how to use tools, and the physics of construction. The MPC stream is the foundation for careers in fields that involve building, designing, and calculating.

            Key Subjects in MPC 📝
        </p>
        <p>
            The main subjects in the MPC stream are:
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematics: This isn't just basic arithmetic. It involves advanced topics like calculus, algebra, and geometry. These skills are essential for logical thinking and are the backbone of engineering and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physics: This subject helps your child understand the laws of the universe. It covers everything from motion and energy to electricity and light. Physics is the foundation of all engineering disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chemistry: This is the study of matter and its properties. It teaches your child about the composition of substances, chemical reactions, and how to create new materials. Chemistry is crucial for fields like medicine, pharmacy, and chemical engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these core subjects, your child will also have to study English and another subject like Computer Science or a different language, depending on the school's curriculum.
