        <p>
            **NDA (National Defence Academy)** is an elite training academy that prepares young men and women to become officers in the Indian Armed Forces (Army, Navy, and Air Force). Students can join the NDA after Class 12 by clearing a rigorous entrance exam and interview.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it as a path to a life of honor, discipline, and service to the nation. If your child is physically fit, disciplined, patriotic, and wants a life of adventure and leadership, NDA is a great choice. It is the **gateway** to a prestigious and respected career as an officer.

            Life at NDA ü´°
        </p>
        <p>
            Life at the NDA is very different from a regular college. The curriculum is a combination of academic studies and military training. Key aspects include:
        </p>
        <p>
            Academic Studies: Students pursue a bachelor's degree (B.Sc., B.A., or B.Tech.) while at the academy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical Training: A strong emphasis is placed on physical fitness, including drills, sports, and endurance training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Military Training: Cadets learn about warfare, strategy, and leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leadership Development: The training is designed to build character, discipline, and a strong sense of duty.
        </p>
        <p>
            The training is rigorous, but it transforms cadets into confident and capable leaders.
