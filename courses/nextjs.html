            <p class="intro">Before you write your first line of code, let's get something straight: your mindset is your most powerful tool. This page is here to give you clarity and confidence before you dive into the technical world of NextJs.</p>

            <h3>Key Mindsets for a Successful Journey</h3>
            
            <div class="card">
                <!-- Placeholder for an image related to implementation -->

                <h4>1. Always Implement After Learning</h4>
                <p>Theory is good, but building is better. After you learn a new concept, immediately try to use it. Create a small piece of a webpage, experiment with a tag, or style an element. This is how knowledge sticks.</p>
            </div>

                <h4>2. Never Compare Your Journey with Others</h4>
                <p>Some people take years to master their craft. If you try to get to their level in a single day, you'll only feel discouraged. Focus on your own progress. Your journey is unique, and every small step forward is a victory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="/images/understand.png" alt="Understanding code">
                <h4>3. Don't Cheat, Understand</h4>
                <p>It's tempting to use AI tools to write code for you, but don't. As a developer, your job is to *understand* the code. Use tools to help you, but always make sure you know what the code is doing and why. True skill comes from understanding, not copying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="/images/errors.png" alt="Debugging code with interest">
                <h4>4. Love the Errors, Not Just the Output</h4>
                <p>Errors will happen. It's a fact of coding. Instead of feeling sad or frustrated, get curious. The developer who loves to hunt down and fix bugs is the one who becomes truly great. Every error is a puzzle waiting to be solved.</p>

    <h3>Turn Knowledge into Projects</h3>
    <p>After you learn the basics of Next.js, the best way to grow is to build a full-stack, server-rendered React application. Explore concepts like page-based routing and API routes. This way, you're not just building a UI; you're creating a complete, performant web application.</p>
    <h4>Simple Project Ideas to Start With:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple blog that fetches posts from a headless CMS or a local file.</li>
        <li>A portfolio website with static pages for projects and an about me section.</li>
        <li>An e-commerce site product listing page using server-side rendering.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h3>Ready to Begin?</h3>
    <p>Remember these points. Keep them in your heart as you learn. Your journey as a developer is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient, be curious, and most importantly, have fun.</p>
