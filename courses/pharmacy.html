            **Pharmacy** is the field of health science that deals with the preparation, dispensing, and proper use of medicines. The undergraduate degree for this is a **B.Pharm (Bachelor of Pharmacy)**, a four-year course that prepares students to work in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
        </p>

            Think of it as the science of medicine. If your child is interested in chemistry, has a scientific mind, and wants to work in a field that has a direct impact on people's health, a career in pharmacy is a great fit. It is the **foundation** for careers in drug development, manufacturing, and healthcare.
