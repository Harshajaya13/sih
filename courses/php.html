            <h3>Key Mindsets for a Successful Journey</h3>
            
            <div class="card">
                <!-- Placeholder for an image related to implementation -->

                <h4>1. Always Implement After Learning</h4>
                <p>Theory is good, but building is better. After you learn a new concept, immediately try to use it. Create a small piece of a webpage, experiment with a tag, or style an element. This is how knowledge sticks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="/images/journey.png" alt="Individual learning journey">
                <h4>2. Never Compare Your Journey with Others</h4>
                <p>Some people take years to master their craft. If you try to get to their level in a single day, you'll only feel discouraged. Focus on your own progress. Your journey is unique, and every small step forward is a victory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="/images/understand.png" alt="Understanding code">
                <h4>3. Don't Cheat, Understand</h4>
                <p>It's tempting to use AI tools to write code for you, but don't. As a developer, your job is to *understand* the code. Use tools to help you, but always make sure you know what the code is doing and why. True skill comes from understanding, not copying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="/images/errors.png" alt="Debugging code with interest">
                <h4>4. Love the Errors, Not Just the Output</h4>
                <p>Errors will happen. It's a fact of coding. Instead of feeling sad or frustrated, get curious. The developer who loves to hunt down and fix bugs is the one who becomes truly great. Every error is a puzzle waiting to be solved.</p>

    <h3>Turn Knowledge into Projects</h3>
    <p>After you learn the basics of PHP, the best way to grow is to build dynamic websites with server-side logic. Create pages that interact with forms and databases. This way, you're not just writing code; you're powering a huge portion of the web.</p>
    <h4>Simple Project Ideas to Start With:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple contact form that sends an email or saves data to a file.</li>
        <li>A user registration and login system with session management.</li>
        <li>A basic blog or CMS where you can create, read, update, and delete posts.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<footer class="next-step">
    <h3>Ready to Begin?</h3>
    <p>Remember these points. Keep them in your heart as you learn. Your journey as a developer is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient, be curious, and most importantly, have fun.</p>
