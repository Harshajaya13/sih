            Steps to Become a Pilot 🛫
        </p>
        <p>
            Becoming a pilot is a multi-step process. Here are the general steps:
        </p>
        <p>
            Class 12: Students should have a background in Physics and Mathematics, as these subjects are crucial for understanding aviation principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flying School: After Class 12, students must join a certified flying school to get their Commercial Pilot License (CPL). This involves a lot of flight training and theoretical exams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Medical Fitness: Pilots must pass a very strict medical examination to ensure they are fit to fly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Airline Training: After getting a CPL, aspiring pilots must go through training with a specific airline to learn to fly their aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            The training is expensive and time-consuming but is the only way to become a professional pilot.
