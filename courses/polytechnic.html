            A **Polytechnic or Diploma** course is a vocational training program that students can pursue right after Class 10. These courses are practical, hands-on, and focused on a specific technical field. Unlike the academic streams (MPC, BiPC), a polytechnic course prepares a student for a specific job from day one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it as a shortcut to a technical career. If your child is good with tools, enjoys working with their hands, and wants to start a career quickly, this is an excellent option. It's the **foundation** for becoming a skilled technician, junior engineer, or a supervisor in a technical field.

            Key Fields in Polytechnic üîß
        </p>
        <p>
            Polytechnic courses cover a wide range of technical fields. Some of the most popular specializations are:
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil Engineering: Designing and constructing buildings, roads, and bridges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mechanical Engineering: Designing and maintaining machines, from car engines to factory equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Electrical Engineering: Working with electricity, power generation, and electronic devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer Engineering: Learning about computer hardware, software, and networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automobile Engineering: Focusing on the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The curriculum is very practical, with a strong emphasis on lab work and workshops, so students get real-world experience.

            Career Paths After Polytechnic üöÄ
        </p>
        <p>
            A diploma from a polytechnic institution can lead to a direct job in a company or to further education. Here are some common paths:
        </p>
        <p>
            Direct Job: Many companies hire diploma holders for roles like Junior Engineer, Technician, or Supervisor. These jobs offer good starting salaries and opportunities for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lateral Entry to B.Tech: A major advantage of a polytechnic diploma is the option for a "lateral entry" into a B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) program. This means your child can join a B.Tech course directly in the second year, saving a year of study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-Employment: With their practical skills, a polytechnic graduate can also start their own business, such as a car repair shop, a computer service center, or a small construction business.
        </p>
