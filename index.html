    "I had no idea which stream to choose after my 10th exams. Everyone was saying something different. This platform helped me understand my own interests. For the first time, I felt confident telling my parents that I wanted to pursue Commerce because I knew why it was the right choice for me."

  "Two years of Inter were a blur. I was good at my subjects but had no clue what degree to pursue or what jobs it would lead to. The roadmap feature was a game-changer. It showed me exactly how a B.Sc. in Computer Science could lead to a career in AI, which is my dream. I finally have a clear plan."

This tool helped us see her passion for creative fields and showed us viable, successful career paths in design. It removed our fear and helped us support her true talent."
