            <h1>Welcome to Your Bootstrap Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build clean, responsive, professional-looking websites without spending months wrestling with CSS. Your search has led you to Bootstrap. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at the vast Bootstrap documentation with a mix of excitement and dread. Grids, components, utilities, forms, accordions... it seems like an endless library of classes to memorize. You want to build something quickly, but the sheer number of options can be paralyzing.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in that noise, copying and pasting components without understanding how they work. You might even be asking yourself, "Will my website just look like every other Bootstrap site?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus on the 20% of Bootstrap that gets you 80% of the results, so you can ignore the rest for now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the library into three core concepts, giving you a framework for understanding everything else later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Design:</strong> We will show you that Bootstrap is not a design dictator, but a powerful set of tools that you control to build your own vision, faster.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: A Single HTML File</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a simple tool: a single `index.html` file. You don't need any complex setup. You just need to add one line of code from the Bootstrap website to link its CSS. Think of this not as installing software, but as giving your plain HTML file superpowers.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap is a "CSS Framework," which is a fancy way of saying it's a giant, pre-written stylesheet full of "classes" you can use. A class is like a label you add to your HTML elements. Instead of writing CSS to make a button blue, you just add `class="btn btn-primary"`. By starting in one HTML file, you get instant visual feedback. You add a class, refresh your browser, and see the change immediately. It's the fastest way to learn.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "I'll have to memorize hundreds of classes!"</strong> You don't. The class names are logical and predictable (`m-4` for margin, `p-4` for padding, `text-center` for centering text). You'll learn to predict them, not memorize them.</p>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Bootstrap expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* enough to build a complete landing page. We will do this by focusing on three vital concepts.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Tools</h3>
                <p>A builder doesn't need every tool in the hardware store to frame a house. They need a hammer, a measuring tape, and a saw. Your first goal is to master Bootstrap's core tools. Add the Bootstrap CSS link to an HTML file and learn *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Grid: The Blueprint.</strong> This is the most important concept. Learn how to create a `.container`, a `.row`, and `.col` classes (`.col-md-6`, `.col-12`). This is how you create responsive layouts that look good on any device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Components: The Prefab Parts.</strong> These are the ready-to-use interface elements. Master the `.btn` for buttons, `.card` for content boxes, and `.navbar` for navigation. Don't try to learn all of them; just these three.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utilities: The Fine-Tuning Tools.</strong> These are classes that do one small job. Learn the spacing utilities (`m-` for margin, `p-` for padding) and the text utilities (`.text-center`, `.fw-bold`).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a two-column layout where each column has a card inside it, without needing to constantly check the documentation for the basic grid classes.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Website Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the tools, let's learn from the pros. Go to the official Bootstrap Examples page, find a simple landing page you like ("Hero" or "Jumbotron" examples are great), and try to recreate it using the classes you've learned.</p>
                <p>This is not about making a pixel-perfect copy. It is an exercise in reverse-engineering. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why does this section take up the full width on mobile but split into three columns on desktop? (This is the responsive grid at work, e.g., `col-12 col-lg-4`.)</li>
                    <li>How did they make that button green and the other one gray? (This is component modifier classes, like `btn-success` and `btn-secondary`.)</li>
                    <li>Why is there more space above this section than below it? (This is spacing utilities, like `py-5` for vertical padding.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To look at a professional website and stop seeing it as a single image, but as a composition of containers, rows, columns, and components.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Responsive Page</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple, one-page personal portfolio using Bootstrap. It should have a navbar at the top, a "hero" section with your name, an "about" section in two columns, and a simple footer.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect test of everything you've learned. It forces you to combine the grid, components, and utilities to create a complete, polished, and responsive page. This is your proof that you can take an idea and build it for the modern web. It is the first thing you can show someone on a phone or a desktop and say, "I built this."</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a single, responsive HTML page that looks good on both your phone and your computer. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>
            </div>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion. You have a clear, actionable mission to go from zero to a fully responsive webpage. The power of professional web design is now at your fingertips, one class at a time.</p>
            <p>Embrace the speed. Bootstrap is designed to get you building, fast. You are ready.</p>
