            <h1>Welcome to Your C Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You decided to learn not just *a* programming language, but *the* foundational language that powers operating systems, databases, and countless other technologies. You chose C. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might feel like you're about to learn how to build a car engine from scratch. You've probably heard horror stories about pointers, memory management, and segmentation faults. C doesn't have the safety nets of modern languages, and that can be intimidating.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in the low-level details, to fall into "tutorial paralysis," reading about memory addresses but never actually writing a program that does something. You might even be asking yourself, "Am I technical enough for this?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will give you a single, focused path that builds from the ground up, so you can ignore the scary topics like pointers until you're ready for them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the machine into small, understandable parts, each one a victory that builds your confidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Think Like a Computer:</strong> We will show you that C is not about being a genius, but about learning a learnable process of giving the computer very precise, explicit instructions.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: The Compiler and a Text File</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with two simple tools: a plain text editor and a C compiler (like GCC). Think of the text file as your blueprint and the compiler as the factory that turns your blueprint into a real, executable program. There's no fancy interface, just you and the machine.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>C forces you to be explicit. There is no magic. By starting with the basics—writing code in a file, compiling it, and running it from the command line—you learn the fundamental process of how all compiled software is created. You are not just learning a language; you are learning what programming *is* at a fundamental level. This direct feedback loop of write, compile, run, and debug is the core skill of a programmer.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "Pointers and memory management are impossible."</strong> You don't have to touch them at the start. You can write incredibly useful programs just by understanding variables, functions, and loops. Pointers are an advanced tool you'll learn when you need them, not before.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "systems programming expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* enough to build a complete, interactive command-line application. We will do this by focusing on the vital few fundamentals.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Instructions</h3>
                <p>A computer program is just a sequence of instructions. Your first goal is to learn the most basic instructions in C. Create a `main.c` file and commit to learning *only* these three things. Ignore pointers, ignore memory allocation, ignore everything else.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables & Data Types: The Boxes.</strong> This is how you store information. Learn to declare an `int` for whole numbers, a `float` for decimals, and a `char` for single characters. Learn to print them using `printf()`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Flow: The Decisions.</strong> This is how your program makes choices. Master the `if-else` statement to run code conditionally and the `for` loop to repeat code a specific number of times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functions: The Building Blocks.</strong> This is how you organize your code. Learn to write a simple function that takes a number as an argument, performs a calculation, and uses `return` to send a value back.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can write a program that loops from 1 to 10 and prints whether each number is even or odd. You should only be thinking about the logic, not the syntax.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Code Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can give instructions, let's read a short story written by someone else. Find a simple C program that acts as a command-line calculator (it takes two numbers and an operator and prints the result). Recreate it yourself.</p>
                <p>This is not about making a perfect copy. It is an exercise in active observation. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is `#include <stdio.h>` at the top? (This is about including standard libraries for input/output.)</li>
                    <li>How does the program get input from the user? (This is the `scanf()` function.)</li>
                    <li>How does the program decide whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide? (This is an `if-else if-else` chain or a `switch` statement.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing a C program as a cryptic text file, and start seeing it as a logical, step-by-step recipe that the computer follows exactly.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Interactive Game</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple, text-based "Guess the Number" game. The program will think of a random number, and the user will have a limited number of tries to guess it.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's a perfect storm of the fundamentals. It requires variables (to store the secret number and the guess), loops (to manage the turns), and conditional logic (to tell the user if their guess is too high or too low). It gives you a tangible, fun result that proves you can build a complete, interactive program in C.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a working game, from start to finish. It doesn't need to be fancy. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion, no more fear of the low-level details. You have a clear, actionable mission to build real programs. You are learning the language that gives you ultimate control over the machine.</p>
            <p>Embrace the precision. C does exactly what you tell it to, which is a superpower. You are ready.</p>
