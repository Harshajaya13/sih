            <h1>Welcome to Your C++ Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build high-performance software, from games to complex systems, and you've chosen C++—the language of power and control. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might feel like you're staring at an intricate machine with a million moving parts. C++ is famously powerful, but also notoriously complex, with a legacy spanning decades. You've probably heard about manual memory management, header files, templates, and the "Rule of Three" (or Five, or Zero), and felt a sense of dread.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in the sheer scale of the language, to fall into "tutorial paralysis," reading about obscure features but never actually compiling a working program. You might be asking, "Is this language too big to learn?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus on "Modern C++" and a single, focused path through its core features, letting you ignore the historical baggage for now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the machine into understandable systems—first the engine, then the transmission, then the wheels—building your confidence step by step.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Handle Complexity:</strong> We will show you that C++'s features are tools for managing complexity, not just complexity for its own sake.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: A Compiler and `main()`</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with the basics: a text editor and a C++ compiler (like G++ or Clang). Your entire world will exist inside a single file containing a `main()` function. This is where you, the programmer, give your first commands to the computer.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>C++ builds upon C, so it shares the same fundamental process: write code, compile it, run it. By starting with a simple command-line program, you learn the core loop of development without the distraction of graphical interfaces or complex frameworks. C++ introduces a crucial new idea right away: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). You're not just writing instructions; you're starting to model the world.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "I have to manage memory or it will explode!"</strong> Modern C++ has made this much, much easier. With tools like smart pointers and standard containers (`std::vector`), you can write large, safe programs without ever using `new` or `delete` manually. We will start there.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "C++ guru." That takes years. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* enough to build a well-structured, object-oriented program. We will do this by focusing on three vital pillars.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Tools</h3>
                <p>A master craftsman knows their most essential tools perfectly. Your first goal is to master the basics of modern C++. In your `main.cpp` file, commit to learning *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables & Control Flow: The Logic.</strong> This is the C-like foundation. Master declaring variables (`int`, `double`, `std::string`), using `if`/`else` for decisions, and `for` loops for repetition. Learn to get input with `std::cin` and print output with `std::cout`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functions & Basic Classes: The Blueprints.</strong> This is the C++ "big idea." Learn to define a simple `class` (e.g., a `Player` class) with private member variables (like `health`) and public member functions (like `takeDamage()`).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Standard Template Library (STL): Your Best Friend.</strong> Don't reinvent the wheel. Learn to use `std::vector` to hold a list of items. It manages its own memory, so you don't have to. This one tool solves a huge category of beginner problems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a simple `Player` class and then create a `std::vector` to hold three instances of your `Player` class.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Code Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you have the tools, let's analyze a working machine. Find a simple C++ implementation of a text-based adventure game or a simple inventory system. Recreate it.</p>
                <p>This is not about copying code. It is an exercise in reverse-engineering the design. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is the player's inventory a `std::vector<Item>` instead of just a bunch of variables? (This is about creating flexible, data-driven systems.)</li>
                    <li>Why is the `Item` itself a `class` with properties like `name` and `value`? (This is about encapsulation and modeling real-world objects.)</li>
                    <li>How does the main game loop ask the player for input and then call a function on the `Player` object? (This is the core of object-oriented program flow.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing a program as one giant `main` function, and start seeing it as a community of objects sending messages to each other.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Small System</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to design a simple "Bank Account" system. You will create an `Account` class that holds a balance and has `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect test of OOP principles. It forces you to manage state (the balance), enforce rules (you can't withdraw more than you have), and separate data from functionality. Then, create a `main` function that creates a couple of `Account` objects and performs transactions. This is a microcosm of how large software systems are built.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a working system with a clear separation between the `Account` class (the blueprint) and the `main` function (the user of the blueprint). Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion about where to start in this vast language. You have a clear, actionable mission to understand the core of modern, object-oriented C++. The power is worth the climb.</p>
            <p>Embrace the structure. C++ gives you the tools to build truly robust and performant software. You are ready.</p>
