            <h1>Welcome to Your C# Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build anything from web apps and APIs to desktop software and games, all on a modern, powerful platform. Your journey has led you to C#. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at the .NET ecosystem and feeling a bit lost. There's C#, .NET, ASP.NET, MAUI, Xamarin, Unity... it's a universe of tools and acronyms. The language itself seems vast, and you're not sure where the lines are drawn between C# the language and .NET the framework.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get stuck in "analysis paralysis," trying to choose the "right" project type before you've even written a line of code. You might be asking, "Do I need to be a Windows expert to use this?" (Spoiler: you don't).</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will start with a simple console application. This is the purest way to learn the C# language itself, away from the complexity of GUIs or web servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the C# language into its fundamental, object-oriented building blocks, giving you the foundation to understand any .NET framework later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Build Anything:</strong> We will show you that C# is a clear, expressive, and logical language, and that the skills you learn here are directly transferable to building a game in Unity or a web API with ASP.NET.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: The .NET CLI</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a powerful tool: the .NET Command-Line Interface (CLI). Open your terminal and type `dotnet new console`. In seconds, it creates a complete, runnable C# program for you. Your playground is the `Program.cs` file it generates.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>C# is a compiled, object-oriented language designed to be both powerful and developer-friendly. The .NET CLI handles all the complex parts of compiling and running your code, so you can just type `dotnet run` and see your results instantly. This immediate feedback loop is crucial for learning. You'll start by writing simple, logical instructions and see how the computer executes them, laying the groundwork for more complex, object-oriented designs.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "This seems too corporate or complicated."</strong> In recent years, .NET has become fully open-source and cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). The tooling is streamlined and beginner-friendly, and the language is designed to prevent common errors, making it a fantastic place to start programming.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a ".NET architect." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in the C# language itself. We will do this by focusing on the vital few fundamentals.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>To write a story, you need to know the words. Your first goal is to master the basic vocabulary of C#. In the `Program.cs` file the CLI made for you, commit to learning *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables & Common Types: The Nouns.</strong> This is how you store information. Master declaring a `string` for text, an `int` for whole numbers, a `double` for decimals, and a `bool` for true/false values. Use `Console.WriteLine()` to see them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Flow: The Logic.</strong> This is how your program makes decisions. Master `if`/`else` statements for branching logic and `for`/`foreach` loops for repetition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods & Basic Classes: The Verbs and Blueprints.</strong> This is the heart of C#. Learn to write a simple Method (a function inside a class) that takes an argument and returns a value. Then, create a simple `class` (e.g., `Book`) with a few properties (`Title`, `Author`).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can write a simple program that asks for your name and then prints a personalized greeting, using a separate method to generate the greeting message.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Code Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the vocabulary, let's read a short story. Find a very simple C# console application, like a number guessing game or a basic contact list. Recreate it from scratch.</p>
                <p>This is not about just copying the code. It is an exercise in active observation. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is the list of contacts a `List<Contact>` instead of just separate variables? (This is the power of Generic Collections.)</li>
                    <li>How does the program get user input from the console? (This is `Console.ReadLine()` and the need to convert it, e.g., `int.Parse()`.)</li>
                    <li>Why is the `Contact` itself a `class`? What benefit does that provide? (This is encapsulation: bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing a program as a single file of commands and start seeing it as a structured system of interacting objects.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Mini-Database</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple, in-memory "Movie Library" console application. You will create a `Movie` class with properties like `Title`, `Director`, and `Year`.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect test. It requires you to define a custom object (`Movie`), store a collection of those objects in a `List<Movie>`), and write methods to `Add`, `Search`, and `Display` movies. This is a microcosm of almost every business application ever written. It proves you can model a real-world problem and solve it with code.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a working console application that lets a user add a movie to a list and then view the entire list. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>
