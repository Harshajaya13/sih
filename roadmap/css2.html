            <h1>Welcome to Your CSS Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You've built the skeleton of a webpage with HTML, but now you want to give it style, life, and personality. Your journey into web design continues with CSS. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at CSS and feeling frustrated. You try to change a color, and nothing happens. You try to move something, and it moves everything else. The rules of "the cascade," specificity, and the box model can feel like a bizarre, unpredictable form of magic.</p>
            <p>It's easy to fall into "div-soup" and "!important" hacks, where you're just throwing code at the wall to see what sticks. You might be asking yourself, "Why is making a simple layout so hard?"</p>

                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus on the modern, fundamental concepts of CSS layout and styling, bypassing the confusing old ways of doing things.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down CSS into three core ideas: selecting elements, styling them, and positioning them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Designer:</strong> We will show you that CSS is a learnable, logical system. Once you understand its rules, you have the power to create any design you can imagine.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: An HTML file and a CSS file</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with two files: your `index.html` from before, and a new file called `styles.css`. In your HTML, you'll add a single `<link>` tag to connect them. This setup is your laboratory. The HTML is your subject, and the CSS is where you conduct your experiments.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Its entire job is to apply styles to your HTML. By keeping them in separate files, you are learning the fundamental principle of web development: separation of concerns. Structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) are different things. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage. The feedback loop is instant: change a line in your CSS, save, and refresh your browser to see your design transform.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "I have to memorize hundreds of properties."</strong> You don't. You only need a handful to make a huge impact. `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and `padding`. You'll learn the rest as you need them. The key is understanding *how to apply them*.</p>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "CSS wizard." That comes with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* enough to style a complete, responsive webpage. We will do this by focusing on three vital concepts.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Mechanics</h3>
                <p>A painter needs to know how to choose a brush, mix a color, and apply it to the canvas. Your first goal is to master the core mechanics of CSS. Link your CSS file and learn *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Selectors: The Brush.</strong> This is how you target an HTML element. Master the element selector (`p`), the class selector (`.my-class`), and the ID selector (`#my-id`). This is how you tell CSS *what* to style.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Box Model: The Canvas.</strong> This is the most critical concept. Understand that every element is a box with four parts: `content`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`. Learn to control the size, spacing, and borders of your elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Properties: The Paint.</strong> Learn a few key properties to change the appearance of your "boxes." Master `color`, `font-size`, `background-color`, and `width`.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can take a plain HTML page and give every `<h1>` a different color, and every element with a class of `.highlight` a yellow background.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Layout Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can style a box, let's arrange the boxes on the page. This used to be the hardest part of CSS, but modern tools have made it simple. We will ignore old, confusing methods and focus on the future. Find a simple website layout—a header, a sidebar, a main content area, and a footer—and try to recreate it.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in deconstruction. As you build, ask yourself one primary question:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How are these major sections arranged? Are they in a row or a column? This is the job of <strong>Flexbox</strong>. Learn how to use `display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`. Flexbox is your secret weapon for arranging items in one dimension (a row OR a column).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing layouts as floating, fragile things and start seeing them as flexible containers that you control. Create a simple two-column layout using Flexbox.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Styled Page</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now combine your knowledge of HTML structure and CSS styling. Your mission is to take the "Recipe" page you built in the HTML roadmap and make it beautiful.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect canvas. Use your CSS skills to give it a pleasing color scheme, readable fonts, and good spacing. Most importantly, use Flexbox to create a two-column layout for the ingredients and instructions on wider screens, but have them stack into a single column on mobile screens (using a media query). This proves you can not only design but design *responsively*.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a webpage that is not just structured, but also intentionally and beautifully designed. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more random guessing. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the art of web design. The power to create beautiful, responsive, and professional websites is now within your grasp.</p>
            <p>Embrace the logic. CSS is a rule-based system. Learn the rules, and you can control the web. You are ready.</p>
