            <h1>Welcome to Your UI/UX Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You answered the questions, you followed your curiosity, and it led you to this path: User Interface and User Experience Design. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be feeling a mix of excitement and sheer terror. On one hand, you're inspired to create amazing things. On the other, the world of design seems like a vast, intimidating mountain to climb. You've probably seen a hundred different "How to Become a Designer" videos, each with a different list of 50 tools you "must" learn.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in that noise, to fall into "tutorial paralysis," where you watch endless videos but never actually create anything. You might even be asking yourself, "Am I creative enough for this?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will give you a single, focused path so you can tune out the distractions and conflicting advice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the mountain into small, manageable hills, each one a victory that builds your confidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are Creative Enough:</strong> We will show you that design is less about innate artistic talent and more about a learnable process of problem-solving.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: Figma</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a tool called <strong>Figma</strong>. But please, don't think of it as just another piece of software to learn. Think of it as a playground—a safe space where your ideas can take visual form for the very first time, with zero code and zero risk.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>In the professional world, design always comes before development. Before a single line of code is written, which costs time and money, designers in Figma create the exact blueprint of the user's experience. They are the architects of the digital world. By starting here, you are learning to think like an architect. You're deciding where the doors go, how the light comes in, and how people will move through the space, long before the first brick is laid.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "But I can't draw!"</strong> You don't have to. UI/UX design is not about illustration; it's about communication and organization. It's about arranging buttons and text in a way that feels intuitive and helpful. If you can organize a room, you can organize a screen.</p>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Figma expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident*. We will do this by focusing on the vital few skills that deliver most of the results.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Sandbox Tools</h3>
                <p>A child in a sandbox doesn't need a hundred toys. They need a bucket, a shovel, and their hands. Your first goal is to master your digital bucket and shovel. Log into Figma and commit to learning *only* these three things. Ignore every other button and menu for now.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frames: The Stage.</strong> This is the container for your design. Learn to create a frame for a desktop screen and another for a mobile screen. This is where your entire play will unfold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shapes & Text: The Actors.</strong> All designs are made of simple elements. Master the rectangle tool (for buttons and content boxes), the circle tool (for profile pictures or icons), and the text tool. Learn to place them, resize them, and arrange them on your stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Colors & Fonts: The Costumes and Tone of Voice.</strong> Learn how to fill your shapes with color and how to change the font, size, and weight of your text. This is how you give your design personality and emotion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you no longer have to think about *how* to make a box. You should only be thinking about *where* the box should go.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Design Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know your tools, it's time to learn from the masters. But we're not going to just "copy" a design; we're going to deconstruct it. Find a simple, clean login page (like Google's, or Dropbox's) and try to recreate it in Figma.</p>
                <p>This is not about making a pixel-perfect replica. It is an exercise in active observation. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is the "Sign In" button so much more prominent than the "Forgot Password" link? (This is about visual hierarchy.)</li>
                    <li>Why is there so much empty space around the form fields? (This is about creating focus and reducing clutter.)</li>
                    <li>What feeling does this font give me? Is it serious? Friendly? Modern? (This is about typography and brand identity.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing websites as just websites, and start seeing them as a series of deliberate design decisions.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Original Piece</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to design a simple, one-page personal portfolio website. It should have three sections: a welcome/hero section at the top, a brief "About Me" section, and a simple footer with your contact information.</p>
                <p>Why this project? Because it's about YOU. It's personal, it's manageable, and completing it will give you a massive, tangible boost of confidence. This project is your flag in the ground. It is the first thing you will have made that is entirely yours. It proves to yourself, and to the world, that you are a designer.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create something, anything, that is 100% yours. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion, no more doubt about where to start. You have a clear, actionable mission. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and you now know exactly what that step is, and the two that follow it.</p>
            <p>Embrace the feeling of being a beginner. It is a wonderful place to be, because it's where all the learning happens. You are ready.</p>

            <p class="next-steps-info">Take your time. Enjoy the process. When you have a portfolio design you're proud of, we'll be right here, ready to guide you on your next great adventure: bringing it to life with HTML & CSS.</p>
