            <h1>Welcome to Your HTML Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build for the web, the most vast and accessible creative platform in human history. Your journey begins here, with HTML, the bedrock of every single website. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at the source code of a webpage and seeing a confusing jumble of angle brackets and mysterious words. `<div>`, `<span>`, `<meta>`, `<a>`... it can look like an ancient, cryptic language. You might be wondering how this plain text turns into the vibrant, interactive websites you use every day.</p>
            <p>It's easy to feel like you're just learning a list of "tags" to memorize. You might even be asking yourself, "Is this even real programming?" or "How can I possibly remember all of these?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus on the most essential, structural tags that form the skeleton of every webpage, ignoring the hundreds of obscure ones for now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will show you that HTML isn't about memorization, but about understanding a simple, logical structure, like an outline for an essay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Builder:</strong> We will show you that by learning just a handful of tags, you can create a real, structured document that can be viewed by anyone, anywhere in the world, on any device.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: A Blank Text File</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with the simplest tool imaginable: a blank text file. Name it `index.html`. That's it. That's your entire development environment. You will write in this file and open it directly in your web browser to see your creation come to life.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not a programming language; it's a *markup* language. Its job is to describe the *content* and give it *meaning*. A paragraph is a paragraph, a heading is a heading, a link is a link. By starting with a plain file, you see this relationship directly. You write `<p>Hello, World</p>`, save, refresh your browser, and you see "Hello, World" on the screen. It is the most direct and satisfying feedback loop in all of tech.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "My page will look ugly!"</strong> That's okay! HTML's job is not to make things beautiful; its job is to give them structure. Beauty comes later, with its partner, CSS. For now, we embrace the default styles of the browser. We are building the skeleton, not choosing the clothes.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "web developer." That comes later. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in creating a well-structured, meaningful web page. We will do this by focusing on the absolute essentials.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Tags</h3>
                <p>You don't need a hundred words to write a sentence. You need a subject, a verb, and an object. Your first goal is to learn the core "words" of HTML. Open your `index.html` file and learn *only* these few tags.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Document Structure: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`.</strong> This is the universal boilerplate for every webpage on Earth. Learn what goes in the head (data about the page, like the `<title>`) and what goes in the body (the content you see).</li>
                    <li><strong>Headings & Paragraphs: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`.</strong> This is how you structure text. Learn that `<h1>` is the main title, `<h2>` is a subtitle, and `<p>` is for ordinary text. This is the foundation of readable content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Links & Images: `<a>` and `<img>`.</strong> This is what makes the web a "web." Learn how to use the `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute to create a clickable link, and the `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute to display an image.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a page with a main heading, a paragraph of text, and a clickable link to another website, all from memory.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Document Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the basic tags, let's learn from the world's biggest library. Go to any simple, text-focused website (like a blog post or a Wikipedia article). Right-click and "View Page Source."</p>
                <p>Don't be intimidated by the mess. Your mission is to find the things you recognize. Ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can I find the main title of the article? Is it wrapped in an `<h1>` tag?</li>
                    <li>Can I find the paragraphs of text? Are they wrapped in `<p>` tags?</li>
                    <li>Find a link on the page. Can you find the corresponding `<a>` tag in the source code and see its `href` attribute?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing web pages as magical images and start seeing them for what they are: structured text documents that your browser knows how to interpret.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Real Page</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to create a simple, one-page "Recipe" website. It can be for your favorite food, a magic potion, anything!</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's a perfect fit for HTML's structural nature. It should have an `<h1>` for the recipe name, an `<img>` of the finished dish, an `<h2>` for "Ingredients" followed by an unordered list (`<ul>` with `<li>` items), and another `<h2>` for "Instructions" followed by an ordered list (`<ol>` with `<li>` items). This project proves you can organize real information into a meaningful structure.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a structured, logical HTML document from scratch that represents a real piece of information. Perfection is not the goal. Completion and structure are.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion, no more intimidation. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the fundamental language of the web. Every journey into web development, design, or content creation starts right here.</p>
            <p>Embrace the simplicity. HTML is logical, forgiving, and instantly rewarding. You are ready.</p>
