            <h1>Welcome to Your Next.js Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You've learned some React, but you want to build fast, production-ready, full-stack web applications without the headache of configuration. Your journey has led you to Next.js, the React Framework. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you're probably hearing a storm of terms: App Router vs. Pages Router, Server Components, Client Components, SSR, SSG, ISR... It can feel like you need to learn two frameworks in one, and the "right way" to do things seems to change with every version. The power of Next.js is undeniable, but its flexibility can be a source of confusion.</p>
            <p>It's easy to fall into "feature paralysis," trying to understand every rendering method before you've even built a single page. You might be asking, "Am I writing front-end code or back-end code? What even is a Server Component?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus exclusively on the modern <strong>App Router</strong>. It is the future of Next.js, and by learning it, you learn the most powerful and scalable patterns first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the framework into three core concepts: routing, layouts, and data fetching. Everything else builds on this foundation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Full-Stack Developer:</strong> We will show you that Next.js isn't just a front-end tool; it's a seamless bridge to the back end, and you can start building full-stack features faster than you ever thought possible.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: A New Next.js App</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a single command in your terminal: `npx create-next-app@latest`. This is your instant development environment. It sets up your entire project, including a local server that automatically reloads as you make changes. Your playground is the `app` directory.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>Next.js is built on the principle of "convention over configuration." The file system *is* your router. You don't configure routes; you create folders. This immediate, intuitive connection between your file structure and your website's URLs is the magic of Next.js. By creating a `page.js` file and seeing it instantly become a route in your browser, you are learning the framework's core philosophy from the very first minute.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "Server Components are confusing and I don't know when to use them."</strong> We'll start with a simple rule: everything is a Server Component by default. They are simple, fast, and can directly access data. You only need to add one line, `"use client"`, when you need interactivity like clicks or state. That's it.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Vercel expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in building a multi-page, data-driven website with Next.js. We will focus on the three pillars of the App Router.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the App Router</h3>
                <p>A website is a collection of pages. Your first goal is to master how Next.js creates those pages. In the `app` directory of your new project, learn *only* these three file conventions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>`page.js`: The Page Content.</strong> This is the React component that defines the UI for a specific route. Learn to create a folder (e.g., `/dashboard`) and put a `page.js` inside it to create the `your-site.com/dashboard` route.</li>
                    <li><strong>`layout.js`: The Shared Shell.</strong> This component wraps your page content. Use it to create a shared navigation bar, header, or footer that appears on every page within that segment of your site. This is the key to avoiding code duplication.</li>
                    <li><strong>`loading.js`: The Instant Feedback.</strong> This is a special file that Next.js will automatically show while the data for your `page.js` is loading. It's a built-in feature for a great user experience that used to be incredibly complex to implement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a simple two-page site (a Home page and an About page) that shares a common navigation bar defined in a root layout.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Data-Fetching Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can build pages, let's fill them with real data. Find a simple, free public API (like the JSONPlaceholder API for posts or users). Your mission is to fetch this data and display it on a page.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in understanding Server Components. Since they run on the server, they can fetch data directly. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can I fetch data in a Server Component? (You can use `async/await` with `fetch` directly inside your page component. It feels like magic.)</li>
                    <li>How do I create a dynamic route to show a single post, like `/posts/1`? (You create a folder named `[id]` and access the `id` from the component's params.)</li>
                    <li>What happens when I navigate between a list page and a detail page? (This is the Next.js router pre-fetching and caching data, making navigations feel instantaneous.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a "blog" index page that lists titles fetched from an API, where each title links to a dynamic page that shows the full blog post.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Interactive Feature</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now bridge the gap between server and client. Your mission is to add a "Like" button to the blog post page you just created. The button itself needs to be interactive, but the page content is static.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It forces you to understand the "use client" boundary. You'll create a new component, `LikeButton.js`, add `"use client"` at the top, and manage its state with `useState`. Then, you will import and use this Client Component inside your `page.js` Server Component. This proves you can seamlessly mix static, server-rendered content with dynamic, client-side interactivity—the core power of the App Router.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a page where most of the content comes from the server, but a small piece of it is an interactive island managed by the client. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion between routers and rendering methods. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the modern, powerful foundation of Next.js. You now understand how to build for the future of the web.</p>
            <p>Embrace the model. Server-first, with islands of interactivity, is a powerful paradigm. You are ready.</p>
