            <h1>Welcome to Your PHP Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build dynamic websites and power the backend of a huge portion of the web. Your journey has led you to PHP, the language that runs WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be hearing that PHP is "old" or "messy." You've probably seen code snippets with a confusing mix of HTML and server logic, and heard horror stories about inconsistent function names. The language has a long history, and that history can seem intimidating.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in outdated tutorials or to think you're learning a "dead" language. You might be asking yourself, "Is this still a relevant skill? Can I write modern, secure code with PHP?" (The answer is a resounding yes).</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus on modern PHP (8.x and beyond), ignoring the old, insecure practices that gave the language its reputation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down web development into a simple request-and-response cycle, showing you exactly where PHP fits in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Backend Developer:</strong> We will show you that modern PHP is a fast, capable, and well-structured language, perfect for building everything from simple scripts to massive applications.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: A Local Server</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a local server environment like XAMPP, MAMP, or Herd. This installs PHP, a web server (Apache), and a database (MySQL) on your machine. Your playground is a single `.php` file placed in the web server's root directory, which you can access in your browser like `http://localhost/myfile.php`.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>PHP was born for the web. Its purpose is to generate HTML. This local server setup perfectly mimics how a real website works. You write PHP code, save the file, and refresh your browser to see the result. This immediate feedback loop shows you the magic: your PHP code runs on the server and sends plain HTML to the browser. You are learning the fundamental architecture of the web.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "My code will be a messy mix of PHP and HTML."</strong> This is a valid concern, based on old practices. We will start by learning to separate logic from presentation. Your PHP will handle the data, and then it will `echo` that data into a well-structured HTML document.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Laravel expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in building dynamic web pages with vanilla PHP. We will do this by mastering the core of server-side scripting.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Syntax</h3>
                <p>Before you can build a house, you need to know how to use a hammer. Your first goal is to master the basic syntax of PHP. In your `.php` file, commit to learning *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PHP Tags & `echo`: The Voice.</strong> Learn how to open and close PHP blocks with `<?php ... ?>` and how to print output to the page with `echo`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variables & Arrays: The Memory.</strong> Master PHP's variable syntax (always starting with a `$`) and how to store a list of items in an `array`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Flow: The Brain.</strong> Learn `if/else` statements to make decisions and the `foreach` loop to iterate over an array and print out its contents.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create an array of your favorite movies and use a `foreach` loop to print them as an HTML unordered list (`<ul>`).</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Request Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can generate content, let's learn to process user input. Create a simple HTML form in one file (`form.html`) that submits to a PHP script (`process.php`). The form should have a single text input for a name and a submit button.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in understanding the request-response cycle. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How does the data from the HTML form get to the PHP script? (This is the `action` and `method="POST"` attributes on the `<form>` tag.)</li>
                    <li>How do I access that data inside my PHP script? (This is the `$_POST` superglobal array, e.g., `$_POST['name']`.)</li>
                    <li>How do I protect my site from bad input? (This is learning about basic sanitization, like using `htmlspecialchars()` before you `echo` user input.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing websites as static pages and start seeing them as a conversation between the user's browser and your server script.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Dynamic Script</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a very simple "Greeting" page. The page will have a form asking for a name. When submitted, the *same page* reloads and displays "Hello, [Name]!" at the top.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It forces you to combine PHP and HTML in a clean way. You'll use an `if` statement to check if the form has been submitted (`if (!empty($_POST))`). If it has, you display the greeting. If not, you just show the form. This single-file script is a microcosm of how most dynamic web pages work.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a single PHP file that can both display a form and process its data. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more fear of PHP's history. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the core of modern, server-side web development. You now have the power to create websites that are truly dynamic.</p>
            <p>Embrace the simplicity. For many tasks on the web, PHP is still the fastest and most direct tool for the job. You are ready.</p>
            <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/getting-started.php" class="cta-button" target="_blank">Go to the PHP Manual. Begin Phase 1.</a>
            <p class="next-steps-info">Take your time. Enjoy the process. When you're comfortable with processing form data, we'll be right here, ready to guide you on your next adventure: connecting to a MySQL database and building a real CRUD application with a framework like Laravel.</p>
