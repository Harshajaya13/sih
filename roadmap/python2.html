            <h1>Welcome to Your Python Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You answered the questions, you followed your curiosity, and it led you to this path: Programming with Python. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be feeling a mix of excitement and sheer terror. On one hand, you're ready to build amazing things. On the other, the world of programming seems like a vast, intimidating mountain to climb. You've probably seen a hundred different "Learn to Code" videos, each with a different list of 50 concepts you "must" learn.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in that noise, to fall into "tutorial paralysis," where you watch endless videos but never actually write any code. You might even be asking yourself, "Am I smart enough for this?" or "I'm not a math person."</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will give you a single, focused path so you can tune out the distractions and conflicting advice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break down the mountain into small, manageable hills, each one a victory that builds your confidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are Logical Enough:</strong> We will show you that programming is less about genius-level math and more about a learnable process of breaking down problems into simple steps.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: The Python Interpreter</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with the <strong>Python Interpreter</strong>. But please, don't think of it as just another piece of software to learn. Think of it as a direct conversation with your computer—a safe space where your instructions are followed instantly, with zero risk.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>In programming, the goal is to give the computer instructions. Python is famous for its simple, readable syntax, which is close to English. The interpreter gives you immediate feedback. You type a command, press Enter, and see the result right away. This is the fastest way to understand the cause and effect of code. You are learning to speak the computer's language, one word at a time.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "But I'm not good at math!"</strong> You don't have to be. Programming is primarily about logic, not complex calculus. It's about organizing steps in the correct order. If you can write a recipe or give someone directions, you have the foundational skills to write a program.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Python expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident*. We will do this by focusing on the vital few concepts that deliver most of the results.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>To have a conversation, you need to know a few basic words. Your first goal is to master the fundamental vocabulary of Python. Open the Python interpreter and commit to learning *only* these three things. Ignore everything else for now.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables & Data Types: The Nouns.</strong> These are the "boxes" you use to store information. Learn to create a variable to hold text (a `string`), a whole number (an `integer`), and a true/false value (a `boolean`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Operators: The Verbs.</strong> This is how you work with your data. Learn how to do basic math (\(+\), \(-\)), compare values (\(>\), \(==\)), and combine logical statements (`and`, `or`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditionals (if/else): The Brain.</strong> This is how your program makes decisions. Learn to write an `if` statement that checks a condition and runs code accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can write a script that asks for a user's age and tells them if they are old enough to vote. You should only be thinking about the *logic*, not the syntax.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Code Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the vocabulary, it's time to read a short story. We're not going to just "copy" code; we're going to deconstruct it. Find a simple "Guess the Number" game written in Python and try to recreate it yourself.</p>
                <p>This is not about making a perfect replica. It is an exercise in active observation. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is the secret number generated *outside* the main loop? (This is about scope and state.)</li>
                    <li>How does the program know if my guess is too high or too low? (This is about conditional logic.)</li>
                    <li>What does `int(input())` do, and why does the program crash if I type letters instead of a number? (This is about data types and error handling.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing programs as magic, and start seeing them as a collection of fundamental building blocks working together.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Original Tool</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple, command-line "Contact Book" application. It should be able to: add a new contact (name and number), look up a number by name, and display all contacts.</p>
                <p>Why this project? Because it's a real tool that solves a problem. It forces you to combine variables, loops, and conditionals to manage a collection of data. It is the first thing you will have made that is entirely yours and genuinely useful. It proves to yourself, and to the world, that you are a programmer.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create something, anything, that works from start to finish. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion, no more doubt about where to start. You have a clear, actionable mission. The journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single `print()`, and you now know exactly what that line is, and the steps that follow it.</p>
            <p>Embrace the feeling of being a beginner. It is a wonderful place to be, because it's where all the learning happens. You are ready.</p>
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" class="cta-button" target="_blank">Go to Python.org. Begin Phase 1.</a>
            <p class="next-steps-info">Take your time. Enjoy the process. When you have a tool you're proud of, we'll be right here, ready to guide you on your next great adventure: building your first website with Flask or Django.</p>
