            <h1>Welcome to Your React Native Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You know some React and you're ready to take your skills to the next level: building real, native mobile apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase. Your journey has led you to React Native. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might feel like you're standing at a confusing crossroads. You have to worry about Xcode, Android Studio, device simulators, and a whole new set of components. You've probably heard that the setup is a nightmare and that debugging can be painful. The line between what's React and what's specific to mobile can feel blurry.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get stuck in "environment setup hell," spending days configuring tools instead of writing code. You might be asking yourself, "Is this going to be as fast and easy as web development? Will my app feel truly 'native'?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will start with <strong>Expo Go</strong>, a tool that lets you run your app on your physical phone in minutes, completely avoiding the initial pain of setting up Xcode and Android Studio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will show you that React Native is just React with a different set of building blocks. Instead of `<div>` and `<p>`, you'll use `<View>` and `<Text>`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Mobile Developer:</strong> We will show you that you can use your existing React knowledge to build a real, installable mobile app that feels smooth and looks great on both iOS and Android.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: Expo Go</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with a single command: `npx create-expo-app my-app`. This sets up a complete React Native project for you. Then, you download the <strong>Expo Go</strong> app on your iOS or Android phone. Scan the QR code from your terminal, and your app instantly appears on your phone. It's magic.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>The developer experience is everything. Expo removes the single biggest barrier to entry for React Native beginners: native tooling. You don't have to think about simulators, build configurations, or native code. You just write JavaScript in your text editor, save, and the app on your phone reloads instantly. You are learning React Native in the most direct and rewarding way possible, focusing on building UI, not on configuration.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "Styling is weird. It's not CSS."</strong> You're right, it's not. It's a JavaScript-based system inspired by CSS. But the properties are almost all the same (`flexbox` is king!), and we'll see how this system makes your styles more maintainable and component-scoped by default.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "senior mobile engineer." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in building a complete, multi-screen mobile app. We will do this by mastering three core concepts.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Components</h3>
                <p>A mobile app is just a collection of views. Your first goal is to master React Native's fundamental building blocks. In your new Expo project, learn *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>`<View>` and `<Text>`: The `div` and `p`.</strong> These are the two most essential components. Learn to use `<View>` to structure your layout and `<Text>` to display any and all text. All other components are built from these.</li>
                    <li><strong>`StyleSheet.create()`: The "CSS-in-JS".</strong> Learn how to create a stylesheet object to define your component's styles. Master basic properties like `backgroundColor`, `fontSize`, and the core of all mobile layout: `flex`, `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`.</li>
                    <li><strong>`Pressable` and `useState`: The Interactivity.</strong> Learn how to use the `Pressable` component to detect user taps. Combine this with the `useState` hook from React to create a simple counter or toggle a piece of text.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can build a single screen with a title and a button that, when pressed, changes the title's text.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Navigation Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can build a screen, let's build an app with multiple screens. The standard for this is a library called React Navigation. Your mission is to build a simple two-screen app: a "Home" screen and a "Details" screen.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in deconstructing app architecture. As you install and configure React Navigation, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a "Stack Navigator"? How does it manage the history of screens I've visited? (It "pushes" new screens onto a stack, which is why you get a "back" button for free.)</li>
                    <li>How do I navigate from the Home screen to the Details screen? (This is using the `navigation.navigate('Details')` function that the library provides.)</li>
                    <li>How can I pass data, like a product ID, from the Home screen to the Details screen? (This is passing "params" in the navigate function: `navigation.navigate('Details', { itemId: 86 })`.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop seeing an app as one giant component and start seeing it as a structured collection of screens that you can move between.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Real App Screen</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple but realistic "User Profile" screen. It should display a user's profile picture, their name, username, and a short bio.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's a perfect test of your layout and component skills. It forces you to use Flexbox to arrange items both vertically and horizontally. You'll need an `<Image>` component for the profile picture, several `<Text>` components for the information, and `<View>` components to group them all together. This is a microcosm of almost every screen in every app you've ever used.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a single, well-designed screen from scratch that looks and feels like a real app. Perfection is not the goal. Completion is.</em></p>
            </div>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more setup hell, no more confusion. You have a clear, actionable mission to leverage your web skills to build for the final frontier: the device in everyone's pocket. You are now a mobile developer.</p>
            <p>Embrace the platform. You are building something real that people can touch and interact with anywhere. You are ready.</p>
