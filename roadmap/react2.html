            <h1>Welcome to Your React Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You've learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now you're ready to build modern, interactive, and scalable user interfaces. Your journey has led you to React, the most popular UI library in the world. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at React and feeling like the rules of web development have been turned upside down. Writing HTML inside JavaScript (JSX)? A whole new way of thinking about state and data flow? An ecosystem of thousands of libraries and tools? It's a lot to take in.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in "state management anxiety," worrying about Redux, MobX, or Zustand before you've even understood what "props" are. You might be asking, "Why is this so complicated? Can't I just use vanilla JavaScript?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will ignore all frameworks, state management libraries, and build tools. We will focus purely on React itself and its core ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break React down into three simple concepts: Components, Props, and State. Every React application is built from these three ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Think in Components:</strong> We will show you that React's component model is a powerful, intuitive way to build complex UIs by breaking them down into small, reusable, and understandable pieces.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: An Online Playground</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins not with a complex local setup, but in an online code editor like CodeSandbox or StackBlitz. These platforms give you a complete, running React application right in your browser. You change the code on the left, and the live preview updates on the right. Instantly.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>React's core job is to "react" to data changes and update the UI accordingly. An instant-reload environment is the best way to see this in action. You change a piece of data, and you see the screen update without a page refresh. This is the "Aha!" moment of React. By removing all the friction of a local setup, you can focus 100% on learning the "React way" of thinking.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "JSX looks weird and breaks the separation of concerns."</strong> It might seem that way at first, but you'll quickly see the power of keeping your markup, logic, and styling for a component *together*. It makes your code more organized and easier to reason about, not less.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "React expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in building a dynamic, component-based user interface. We will do this by mastering the three pillars of React.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Trio</h3>
                <p>An entire React application is just a tree of components passing information down and managing their own little worlds. Your first goal is to master this flow. In your online playground, learn *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Components & JSX: The Building Blocks.</strong> Learn to write a JavaScript function that returns JSX (HTML-like syntax). This is a React Component. Create a simple `<Button>` component and a `<WelcomeMessage>` component.</li>
                    <li><strong>Props: The Information Flow.</strong> "Props" (properties) are how a parent component sends data down to a child. Learn to pass a `name` prop to your `<WelcomeMessage>` component so you can render `<WelcomeMessage name="Alice" />`.</li>
                    <li><strong>State: The Memory.</strong> "State" is a component's private memory. Learn the `useState` hook to create a variable that, when changed, will cause React to re-render the component. Create a simple counter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a simple `<Greeting>` component that takes a `name` as a prop, and has a button that, when clicked, toggles the greeting message between "Hello" and "Goodbye" using state.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Data Flow Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can build a single component, let's make two components talk to each other. The classic example is a simple To-Do list. You'll have an `App` component that holds the list of to-dos, an `InputForm` component, and a `TodoList` component.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in deconstructing "lifting state up." As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where should the `todos` array live? In the `TodoList` component, or the `App` component? (Answer: The `App` component, because it's a "shared parent".)</li>
                    <li>How does the `InputForm` tell the `App` to add a new to-do? (Answer: The `App` passes a function down to the `InputForm` as a prop, e.g., `<InputForm onAddTodo={handleAddTodo} />`.)</li>
                    <li>How does the `TodoList` know what to display? (Answer: The `App` passes the `todos` array down as a prop, e.g., `<TodoList todos={todos} />`.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To understand that in React, data flows down via props, and events (and data) flow up via function calls passed as props.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Interactive UI</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple "Accordion" UI element. It consists of a list of items, each with a title and content. Only one item's content can be visible at a time. Clicking a different title collapses the open one and expands the new one.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's a perfect test of your React skills. It requires you to manage state (which item is currently active), map over an array of data to render the items, and handle click events to update that state. It's a self-contained, reusable, and genuinely useful component—the essence of React development.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a working, interactive UI component that manages its own state cleanly. Perfection is not the goal. Completion and functionality are.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more confusion, no more anxiety about the ecosystem. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the fundamental principles of React. You can now build modern, declarative user interfaces for any application.</p>
            <p>Embrace the component model. It will change the way you think about building for the web. You are ready.</p>

            <p class="next-steps-info">Take your time. Enjoy the process. When you're comfortable with props and state, we'll be right here, ready to guide you on your next great adventure: fetching data with the `useEffect` hook and building multi-page apps with a framework like Next.js.</p>
