            <h1>Welcome to Your Rust Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You're seeking performance, reliability, and memory safety without a garbage collector. You've heard whispers of a language that's loved by its users and is powering the future of systems programming. Your journey has led you to Rust. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you're probably staring at the Rust compiler's error messages and feeling like you're in a fight with the language itself. The "Borrow Checker" seems like a mythical beast designed to prevent your code from ever compiling. Ownership, lifetimes, traits... the concepts are new, and the learning curve is famously steep.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get frustrated and quit, to feel like you're not "smart enough" for Rust. You might be asking, "Why is this so difficult? Why can't I just make it work?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will ignore complex generics, macros, and unsafe code. We will focus on making peace with the borrow checker and understanding its core rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will show you that the compiler is not your enemy; it is your best friend—a tireless mentor pointing out potential bugs before they ever happen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Tame the Beast:</strong> We will show you that Rust's strictness is not arbitrary. It's a set of rules that, once learned, empowers you to write incredibly fast and safe code with confidence.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: Cargo</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins with Rust's package manager and build tool, <strong>Cargo</strong>. With one command, `cargo new my_project`, you get a "Hello, world!" program, a dependency file, and a build system. You'll write your code in `src/main.rs` and run it with a single, simple command: `cargo run`.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>Cargo is the gateway to the Rust ecosystem. It compiles your code, runs your code, tests your code, and manages your dependencies. By starting with Cargo, you are learning the standard, idiomatic way to build Rust projects from day one. The write-compile-run loop is central to learning Rust. The compiler's messages, though initially intimidating, are your primary learning tool. We will learn to read them, not fear them.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "The borrow checker is impossible to understand."</strong> The borrow checker has three simple rules. We will focus only on them: 1. Each value has a single owner. 2. There can only be one owner at a time. 3. You can have multiple immutable borrows OR one mutable borrow, but not both.</p>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "systems programmer." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in writing small, correct, and idiomatic Rust programs. We will achieve this by tackling the borrow checker head-on.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Rules</h3>
                <p>Before you can write a program, you must understand the rules of the game. Your first goal is to understand Rust's core concepts of ownership and control flow. In your Cargo project, learn *only* these three things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables, Mutability & Types: The Data.</strong> Learn to declare variables with `let`, make them mutable with `mut`, and understand Rust's strong, static types like `i32`, `f64`, `bool`, and `String`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ownership & Functions: The Move.</strong> Write a function that takes a `String` as an argument. See what happens when you try to use that `String` again after calling the function. This is your first encounter with **move semantics**. Now, learn how to pass a **borrow** (`&String`) instead to allow the function to use the value without taking ownership.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structs & Methods: The Blueprints.</strong> Learn to group data together using a `struct`. Then, learn to define an `impl` block to add methods to your struct, including methods that take an immutable borrow (`&self`) or a mutable borrow (`&mut self`).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a `Rectangle` struct with width and height, and an `area` method that calculates its area by borrowing itself immutably.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Compiler Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the rules, let's learn from the official tutorial. The best way to learn Rust is to build the "Guessing Game" project from Chapter 2 of the official Rust book ("The Book"). Recreate it from scratch.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in listening to the compiler. As you build, the compiler will yell at you. Your job is to be a detective and figure out why. Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why does `io::stdin().read_line()` need a *mutable* borrow of my `guess` variable? (Because it needs to write the user's input into it.)</li>
                    <li>What is this `Result` type that `read_line` and `.parse()` return? (This is Rust's way of handling errors explicitly, forcing you to deal with both the success (`Ok`) and failure (`Err`) cases.)</li>
                    <li>What is the `match` statement doing? Why is it better than a simple `if/else` here? (Because it forces you to handle every possible outcome, making your code more robust.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To complete the Guessing Game and to see a compiler error not as a failure, but as a helpful clue on the path to writing correct code.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First CLI Tool</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simplified version of the command-line tool `grep`. Your program will take two command-line arguments: a file path and a string to search for. It will then read the file and print out any lines containing that string.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect crucible for your new skills. It requires you to read command-line arguments (working with `std::env`), open and read a file (working with `std::fs` and error handling with `Result`), iterate over the lines, and borrow data without upsetting the borrow checker. Completing this proves you can write a real, useful, and efficient program in Rust.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a working command-line tool that successfully reads a file and prints results. Perfection is not the goal. Compilation and completion are.</em></p>

            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more fighting the compiler. You have a clear, actionable mission to understand the core principles that make Rust so powerful. You've faced the borrow checker and won. The world of high-performance, safe, concurrent programming is now open to you.</p>
            <p>Embrace the compiler. It is your guide and your safety net. You are ready.</p>
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" class="cta-button" target="_blank">Go Read "The Book". Begin Phase 1.</a>
            <p class="next-steps-info">Take your time. Enjoy the process. When you've built your `grep` clone, we'll be right here, ready to guide you on your next great adventure: `enums`, `traits`, and the powerful collections like `HashMap`.</p>
