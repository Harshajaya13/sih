            <h1>Welcome to Your Tailwind CSS Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You know CSS, but you're tired of inventing class names, managing huge stylesheets, and fighting with specificity. You're looking for a faster, more systematic way to build custom designs. Your journey has led you to Tailwind CSS. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you're probably looking at a Tailwind code example and thinking, "This is hideous!" The long, seemingly random strings of classes in the HTML can feel like a chaotic mess. It looks like "inline styles," which you were taught to avoid at all costs. The initial visual clutter is a huge hurdle for many developers.</p>
            <p>It's easy to dismiss it as a fad or to feel like you're losing the "art" of writing clean CSS. You might be asking, "Why would I ever write <code>flex items-center justify-between</code> instead of a simple <code>.card-header</code> class?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will ignore the initial aesthetic shock and focus on the incredible speed and consistency that Tailwind's system provides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will show you that Tailwind isn't a random collection of classes, but a well-designed, predictable system based on a constrained design palette.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Are a Faster Developer:</strong> We will show you that by never leaving your HTML, you can build and refactor UIs at a speed you never thought possible, without ever worrying that a style change in one place will break something else.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: The Tailwind Play CDN</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins in the simplest way imaginable: a single HTML file. By adding one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that points to the Tailwind Play CDN, you instantly unlock the entire Tailwind utility library. You don't need Node.js, NPM, or any build steps. Just an HTML file and your browser.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>The key to "getting" Tailwind is to experience its feedback loop. With the Play CDN, that loop is instantaneous. You add a class like <code>bg-sky-500</code> to an element in your HTML, save, and refresh your browser. The background turns blue. You add <code>p-4</code>, and it gets padding. You add <code>rounded-lg</code>, and it gets rounded corners. You are building a custom design, utility by utility, without ever opening a CSS file. This is the "Aha!" moment.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "My HTML will become unreadable and impossible to maintain."</strong> This is a valid concern. We'll see how this is solved by creating reusable components (in frameworks like React/Vue) or using Tailwind's <code>@apply</code> directive. But first, we must embrace the utility-first workflow to understand its power.</p>

            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Tailwind guru." Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* enough to build any custom design you can imagine, directly in your HTML. We will do this by mastering the core utility categories.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Utilities</h3>
                <p>A design is just spacing, color, and typography. Your first goal is to master the utilities that control these. In your CDN-powered HTML file, learn *only* these three categories of classes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sizing & Spacing: The Layout.</strong> These are the most important. Master <code>p-*</code> for padding, <code>m-*</code> for margin, and <code>w-*</code>/<code>h-*</code> for width and height. Notice how they use a consistent numeric scale (<code>4</code> = 1rem).</li>
                    <li><strong>Colors: The Paint.</strong> Learn how to apply colors to backgrounds (<code>bg-slate-800</code>), text (<code>text-yellow-300</code>), and borders (<code>border-green-500</code>). Explore the rich, pre-defined color palette.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexbox & Grid: The Arrangement.</strong> Master the utilities for layout. Learn <code>flex</code>, <code>items-center</code>, <code>justify-between</code> for one-dimensional layouts. Then learn <code>grid</code> and <code>grid-cols-3</code> for two-dimensional layouts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a simple, centered button with a specific background color, text color, and padding, entirely from memory.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Component Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the building blocks, let's learn from the masters. Go to a component gallery like Tailwind UI or Flowbite and find a simple component, like a "Card" or an "Alert" banner. Your mission is to rebuild it from scratch, just by looking at it.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in reverse-engineering a design with utilities. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did they make the card shadow appear only on hover? (This is a state variant: <code>hover:shadow-lg</code>.)</li>
                    <li>How does the layout change from a single column on mobile to two columns on a medium screen? (This is a responsive prefix: <code>md:grid-cols-2</code>.)</li>
                    <li>How did they style the text to be large and bold in the header but small and gray in the body? (This is just a combination of typography utilities: <code>text-lg font-bold</code> vs <code>text-sm text-slate-500</code>.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To look at a professional UI and stop seeing "a card," but instead see a <code>div</code> with padding, a border, a shadow, and a flex container inside it.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Custom Component</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a beautiful, responsive "Pricing Card" component. It should have a title (e.g., "Pro Plan"), a price, a list of features, and a call-to-action button.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It's the perfect test of all your skills. It requires you to use typography, spacing, colors, and layout utilities together to create a polished, custom design. It should look good on a large screen, but also stack nicely on a mobile screen. This proves you can build professional-grade components without writing a single line of custom CSS.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a visually appealing, responsive component from scratch that looks exactly how you want it to. Perfection *is* the goal here, because Tailwind gives you the tools to achieve it easily.</em></p>
            </div>

        <section class="next-step">
            <h2>You Are Ready. The Path Is Clear.</h2>
            <p>That's it. That is your plan. No more messy CSS files, no more fighting specificity. You have a clear, actionable mission to master the utility-first workflow and build UIs at lightning speed. You've unlocked a new level of productivity.</p>
            <p>Embrace the system. The constraints of the design system are what give you speed and consistency. You are ready.</p>
