            <h1>Welcome to Your Vue.js Roadmap</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">So, you're here. You want to build interactive and dynamic web interfaces with a framework that is approachable, versatile, and a joy to use. Your search has led you to Vue.js, the Progressive JavaScript Framework. Take a moment to appreciate that. You've just taken the most important step—the first one.</p>

            <h2>Before We Begin, Let's Be Honest</h2>
            <p>Right now, you might be looking at Vue and wondering where it fits in. It's not backed by a giant corporation like React or Angular, and you've probably heard confusing terms like the "Options API vs. Composition API." The different ways to write Vue code can make it hard to know where to start.</p>
            <p>It's easy to get lost in tutorials that teach older patterns or to feel overwhelmed by the ecosystem of tools like Vuex/Pinia and Vue Router. You might be asking, "Am I learning the 'right' way? Is this powerful enough for large applications?"</p>
            
            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This Roadmap Was Written to Be Your Anchor. Its Purpose Is to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silence the Noise:</strong> We will focus exclusively on the modern <strong>Composition API</strong> with the <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> syntax. It is the simplest, most powerful, and future-forward way to write Vue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fight Overwhelm:</strong> We will break Vue down into three core ideas: reactive state, template syntax, and event handling. These are the pillars of any Vue application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prove You Can Build Anything:</strong> We will show you that Vue's approachability doesn't sacrifice power. You can start small and progressively add features to build massive, scalable applications.</li>

            <h2>Your First Creative Sandbox: The Vue SFC Playground</h2>
            <p>Your journey begins in the official <strong>Vue SFC Playground</strong>. This is a live-reloading code editor right in your browser. It gives you a "Single-File Component" (<code>.vue</code> file) divided into three sections: <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>. No installation, no build steps, just pure Vue.</p>
            <h3>Why Is This the Right Place to Start?</h3>
            <p>The Single-File Component is the heart of the Vue development experience. It perfectly organizes all the code related to a piece of your UI—the HTML structure, the JavaScript logic, and the CSS styles—all in one place. The playground lets you experience this elegant workflow instantly. You change a piece of data in your script, and the template updates automatically. It's the "Aha!" moment of reactivity.</p>
            <p><strong>A common fear is, "Do I have to learn a bunch of custom syntax like <code>v-if</code> and <code>@click</code>?"</strong> Yes, but these "directives" are one of Vue's greatest strengths. They are clear, concise, and incredibly powerful. You'll quickly see that writing <code>v-if="isLoggedIn"</code> is much cleaner and more readable than the equivalent JavaScript code.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="action-plan">
            <h2>Your Foundational Mission: A 3-Phase Plan to Confidence</h2>
            <p>Our mission is not to make you a "Vue expert." That will come with time. Our mission is to make you *capable* and *confident* in building a reactive, component-based application. We will do this by mastering the core of the Composition API.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: Master the Core Reactivity Loop</h3>
                <p>A Vue app is all about state and UI staying in sync. Your first goal is to master this connection. In the SFC Playground, learn *only* these three things inside a <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> block.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reactive State: <code>ref()</code>.</strong> This is how you create a piece of data that will make the template update when it changes. Learn to create a reactive variable with <code>const count = ref(0)</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Template Syntax: The Double Braces.</strong> This is how you display your reactive state in the HTML. Learn to render your <code>count</code> variable in the template using <code>{{ count }}</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Handling: <code>@click</code>.</strong> This is how the user interacts with your app. Learn to add a <code>@click</code> listener to a button that calls a function to modify your reactive state, e.g., <code>@click="count++"</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> Practice until you can create a simple counter component from memory. It should display a number and have a button that increments it.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: Become a Directive Detective</h3>
                <p>Now that you can handle a single piece of state, let's work with lists and forms. The classic example is a simple To-Do list. You'll need an input field, a button, and a list to display the to-dos.</p>
                <p>This is an exercise in deconstructing Vue's powerful directives. As you build, ask yourself questions a detective would ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do I connect the input field's value to a variable in my script? (This is the magic of <code>v-model</code>. It creates a two-way binding.)</li>
                    <li>How do I render a list of items from an array in my script? (This is the <code>v-for</code> directive, which is like a <code>foreach</code> loop for your template.)</li>
                    <li>How can I show a message like "Nothing to do!" only when the list is empty? (This is conditional rendering with <code>v-if</code> and <code>v-else</code>.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To stop thinking about manual DOM manipulation and start letting Vue's directives do the heavy lifting of keeping your UI in sync with your data.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: The Creator's Leap—Your First Computed Property</h3>
                <p>This is the most important phase. You will now transition from a student to a creator. Your mission is to build a simple "Full Name" generator. It will have two input fields: one for a first name and one for a last name. Below them, it will display the full name combined.</p>
                <p>Why this project? It introduces you to one of Vue's most powerful features: <strong>computed properties</strong>. Instead of manually concatenating the names every time one of them changes, you will define a <code>computed</code> property that depends on the <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> refs. Vue will automatically update the full name whenever one of its dependencies changes. This is the essence of writing clean, declarative, and efficient code in Vue.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Your Goal for this Phase:</strong> To create a reactive UI where some of the data is derived automatically from other pieces of state. Perfection is not the goal. Understanding reactivity is.</em></p>
